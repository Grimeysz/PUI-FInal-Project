        <h2><strong>Middle Ages</strong> The treasure book
            Antiquity<br></br></h2>
        <p>
          Until the early 1800s, and particularly during the Middle Ages or the
          Renaissance, the book was a precious object for two reasons: its
          content and its form. First, it contains almost exclusively sacred
          texts: the holy word, a religious treasure, is reserved for monks. You
          might as well say that we rarely had a Bible on our bedside table at
          home - besides, between us, we still had to know how to read. 
          <br></br>
          If we
          take into account the fact that before 1450 each line was handwritten,
          decorated with gold illuminations, and that the covers are works of
          art in their own right, we understand better why its form was as
          precious as its content. 
          <br></br>
          Before, book "covers" looked like this:
          hand-engraved or embossed bindings, precious stones, ivory, silk,
          clasps, embroidery, leather, and gold and silver threads. The kind of
          book that it would be a little hard to slip into your handbag in the
          subway (see large by clicking on the picture). 
          <br></br>
          The book was at the
          time a medium reserved for scholars, which was consulted on the spot
          and passed on like a treasure, solidly protected to last over the
          years.

          <h2><strong>1450</strong> The Printing Revolution
              <br></br></h2>
          <p>
              With the invention of lead movable type printing by this dear Gutenberg in 1450, we see the appearance of more and more books a little less precious, with embossed leather covers. Less time, less manpower, more books!
