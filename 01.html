The book is the cover to protect and enhance it. But it will take time to go from precious stone inlays to polychrome prints! A few centuries and several wars, to be precise.</h3>

        <h2><strong>Middle Ages</strong> The treasure book
            Antiquity<br></br></h2>
        <p>
          Until the early 1800s, and particularly during the Middle Ages or the
          Renaissance, the book was a precious object for two reasons: its
          content and its form. First, it contains almost exclusively sacred
          texts: the holy word, a religious treasure, is reserved for monks. You
          might as well say that we rarely had a Bible on our bedside table at
          home - besides, between us, we still had to know how to read. 
          <br></br>
          If we
          take into account the fact that before 1450 each line was handwritten,
          decorated with gold illuminations, and that the covers are works of
          art in their own right, we understand better why its form was as
          precious as its content. 
          <br></br>
          Before, book "covers" looked like this:
          hand-engraved or embossed bindings, precious stones, ivory, silk,
          clasps, embroidery, leather, and gold and silver threads. The kind of
          book that it would be a little hard to slip into your handbag in the
          subway (see large by clicking on the picture). 
          <br></br>
          The book was at the
          time a medium reserved for scholars, which was consulted on the spot
          and passed on like a treasure, solidly protected to last over the
          years.

          <h2><strong>1450</strong> The Printing Revolution
              <br></br></h2>
          <p>
              With the invention of lead movable type printing by this dear Gutenberg in 1450, we see the appearance of more and more books a little less precious, with embossed leather covers. Less time, less manpower, more books!

          <h2><strong>16th - 19th centuries</strong> My Binder is Rich
              <br></br></h2>
          <p>
            At the time and until the 19th century, a book was bought uncovered with only a temporary seam, and wrapped in paper. The buyer has it assembled and bound by a specialist, where he can choose his "style": all leather, paper, gold gilt edge, touch of red and embossed... according to his budget. The book still remains a very beautiful object which does not throne on all the shelves, and on which the purchaser can afford some fantasies.
            <br></br>
            Below is an example of leather binding from the late 16th century. There are lots of pictures of old books to discover on the Michigan State University Library site, if you want to see even more leather.
          <br></br>
          In the 17th and 18th centuries, leather binding with a golden edge, sometimes with touches of blue or red, was given pride of place. The use of marbled paper is gradually being introduced to reduce costs and enhance aesthetics. Books are more sophisticated but increasingly easy to make; the work and binding techniques are simplified.

Here, book bindings between 1600 and 1820 (the last, blue, marks the change of century and technique).
